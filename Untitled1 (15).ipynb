    "Q2. Preprocess the data by cleaning missing values, removing outliers, and transforming categorical\n",
    "variables into dummy variables if necessary.\n",
    "ans-As a data scientist, it is crucial to preprocess the data before training a decision tree classifier model. Here are the steps that can be taken to preprocess the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values: Missing values in the dataset can affect the performance of the decision tree model. The missing values can be handled in different ways, depending on the nature and distribution of the missing data. Common techniques include imputation, where missing values are replaced with estimated values based on mean, median, or mode of the respective variable, or deletion, where rows or columns with missing values are removed from the dataset. For example, if there are missing values in the \"Insulin\" variable, they can be imputed using the mean or median of the available values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing outliers: Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data and can adversely affect the decision tree model's accuracy. Outliers can be detected using statistical techniques, such as the Z-score or the IQR (Interquartile Range) method, and removed from the dataset to reduce their impact on the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transforming categorical variables: If the dataset contains categorical variables, such as \"Pregnancies,\" they need to be transformed into numerical values before training the decision tree model. One common approach is to convert categorical variables into dummy variables, also known as one-hot encoding. This creates a binary (0/1) variable for each category, indicating the presence or absence of that category in the original variable. For example, the \"Pregnancies\" variable can be transformed into dummy variables, where each category (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) is represented as a binary variable (e.g., \"Pregnancy_0\", \"Pregnancy_1\", \"Pregnancy_2\", \"Pregnancy_3\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling numeric variables: If the numeric variables in the dataset are on different scales, it may be necessary to scale them to a common range to prevent any bias towards variables with larger values. Common scaling techniques include normalization (e.g., Min-Max scaling) or standardization (e.g., Z-score scaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling class imbalance: If the outcome variable \"Outcome\" is imbalanced, meaning that the number of diabetic and non-diabetic patients is significantly different, it may lead to biased predictions. Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using weighted loss functions can be applied to address class imbalance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has been preprocessed, it can be used to train a decision tree classifier model to predict the outcome variable \"Outcome\" (0 or 1) based on the clinical variables, including \"Pregnancies,\" \"BloodPressure,\" \"Insulin,\" and \"DiabetesPedigreeFunction.\" The preprocessed data will help ensure that the decision tree model is trained on clean, standardized, and balanced data, which can lead to better model performance and more accurate predictions.\n",

For example, use k=5 or k=10 for 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. This involves dividing the training set into k equal-sized folds, training the decision tree model on k-1 folds, and validating the model on the remaining fold.
